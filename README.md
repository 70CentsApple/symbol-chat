This client side mod allows you to paste special characters into the chat, on signs and in the anvil text box.
It also has support for a customizable kaomoji list.
Additionally, you can select a unicode font that is supported by minecraft,
and your typed text will automatically get converted into the supported characters.
All symbols are supported by minecraft, meaning everyone can see them, without needing the mod on their client and the server.

## Config

Some aspects of this mod are configurable using [Cloth config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) (not required).
The configuration screen is accessible through the button on the top of the chat screen, as well as the [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) config button.
You can specify custom symbols in the configuration screen, which will appear in the last "custom" symbol tab.

## Font selection

On the top right of the chat screen, you can choose between multiple different fonts.
Everything you type will get converted to that font,
which makes use of unicode characters to produce a more interesting looking text.
